Code Style:

import:
    PLEASE DO NOT USE "from ___ import *" JUST SAY "import ____"
    I know that the proffessor did but this is not best practice and is frowned upon
    it makes it unclear when you are using functionality from a module
    it helps to know when a class or variable is coming from somewhere else and where it's from


variable and function names: 
    underscore separated lowercase

class names:
    first capitalized
